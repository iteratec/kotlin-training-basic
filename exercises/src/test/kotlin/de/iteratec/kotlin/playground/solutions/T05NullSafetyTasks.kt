     * As a compromise, Java functions return so-called platform types (String!, Int!, ...), which cannot be defined by
     * hand. Platform type behave more or less like non-nullable types but can throw a NullPointerException on unsafe
     * access. You can assign platform values to nullable or non-nullable variables.
     *
     * Execute the test & see what happens 😉.
