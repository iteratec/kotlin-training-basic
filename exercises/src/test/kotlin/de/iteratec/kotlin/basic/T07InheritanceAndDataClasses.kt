 # Inheritance and data classes
 Requirements:
 - Classes

 Things to discuss:
 - Inheritance basic syntax
 - open keyword
 - Overwriting methods
 - Customizing getters and setters
 - Data classes

    // from an interface is simpler since interfaces do not have constructors, and you only have to supply the name of
